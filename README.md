## Structure

Experiments can be found in `experiments/`. Experiments measuring the prior strength manipulations for novelty and preference in Experiment 4 can be found in `experiments/Ex2_novelty` and `experiments/Ex2_preference` respectively. To run the experiments, download the repository and click on the respective `.html` file.

The main manuscript and the supplementary material can be found in `papers/full_paper/`. For an easy to read version, open the respective `.pdf` files. For detailed information about the analyses reported in the manuscript or the supplementary material, take a look at the respective `.Rmd` files.

All data sets can be found in `stats/data/`. 

Code for cognitive models and Bayesian parameter estimation can be found in `papers/full_paper/models.Rmd` (see `papers/full_paper/models.html` for a rendered version).

Model predictions for probabilistic models and some summary statistics are saved as `.rds` files in `stats/saves/`.
